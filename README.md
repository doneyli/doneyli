# Hey, I'm Don

## Principal AI Architect @ ClickHouse | Builder | AI-Native

I build at the intersection of AI and data infrastructure. 20+ years in the space, from Deutsche Bank trading floors to Snowflake's founding GenAI practice ($0 to $22M ARR), now helping shape the future of real-time AI at ClickHouse.

I live on the bleeding edge where uncertainty is high but so is the reward. I'm AI-native: Claude Code is my daily driver, I architect while AI executes, and I ship things that didn't exist yesterday. Not because it's trendy, but because this is genuinely the most exciting time to be building.

Right now I'm obsessed with: agent architectures, AI observability, real-time data infrastructure, and figuring out what "AI-native engineering" actually looks like in production.

### What I'm Building

I believe the best way to understand a technology is to build with it. My repos reflect what I'm learning and shipping in real time.

#### [Claude Code + Langfuse Observability](https://github.com/doneyli/claude-code-langfuse-template)
Self-hosted observability for AI coding agents. Born from wanting to actually see what my AI tools were doing under the hood. Wrote about it on Substack, it hit 14K views in 6 days.
- **Stack:** Python, Shell, Docker, Langfuse, Claude Code
- **Why it matters:** If you're using AI coding agents without observability, you're flying blind

#### [ClickHouse Agent Skills](https://github.com/ClickHouse/agent-skills) (297+ stars)
Official agent skills that teach AI coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot) ClickHouse best practices. 28 rules covering schema design, query optimization, and data ingestion patterns.
- **Stack:** JavaScript, TypeScript, Agent Skills framework
- **Why it matters:** Domain expertise, packaged for the agent era

### Current Focus

- Building AI & data infrastructure at ClickHouse
- Shipping open source tools for AI observability and agent development
- Writing ["Distilling Data & AI"](https://doneyli.substack.com/) on Substack: practitioner tutorials, not news curation
- Speaking circuit: TEDx, SaaS North, McGill, and more
- Leading Montreal's AI community with monthly events

### Writing & Speaking

I write about what I build and what I learn from enterprise AI deployments. No fluff, no hype, just what actually works.

- [Newsletter](https://doneyli.substack.com/) - "I Built X" tutorials and framework deep-dives
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/doneyli/) - Daily insights on AI and data in production
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/doneyli) - Real-time technical commentary
- [Speaking](https://sessionize.com/doneyli/) - Talks, keynotes, and workshops

### A Few Things About Me

- I'm the only "Doneyli" on the Internet (yes, look it up)
- Based in Montreal, where great poutine meets great tech
- TEDx speaker, co-authored an AI book (published 2025)
- Trilingual: English, Spanish (native), French
- Constantly learning, constantly building, constantly shipping
